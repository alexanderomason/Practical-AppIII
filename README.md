# Practical-AppIII
3rd practical application

This project explores the relationship between seven categories and whether a customer is receptive to a marketing call.
Many of the seven features are categorical; as such, we manually apply one hot encoding to the data by producing a large number of dummy features with binary values.
With this now completely numerical data we center the purely numeric features around the mean and divide by the standard distribution making said features standard normal.
The now-transformed dataset is then used for a variety of predictive models and hyperparameter tuning as is further explored.
